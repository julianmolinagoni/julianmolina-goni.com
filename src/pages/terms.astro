        This page explains the general terms, limitations, and disclaimers that apply to any
        services I provide, including automation, cloud engineering, development, and consulting.

      <!-- Nature of Services -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-2">1. Nature of Services</h2>
        <p>
          All services are provided on a best-effort basis, based on the information, access,
          and requirements supplied by the client. I provide technical services such as
          automation scripting, cloud engineering, software development, troubleshooting,
          and consulting. These services are not legal, financial, or compliance advice.

      <!-- No Guarantee of Results -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-2">2. No Guarantee of Specific Results</h2>
        <p>
          While I aim to deliver high-quality, reliable work, I cannot guarantee specific business
          outcomes, such as revenue, traffic, user growth, or performance benchmarks. Any examples
          of prior results (such as cost savings, time savings, or performance improvements) are
          illustrative only and may not be replicated in every environment.
        </p>

      <!-- Client Responsibilities -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-2">3. Client Responsibilities</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
          The client is responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Providing accurate, complete, and timely requirements and information.</li>
          <li>Ensuring they have the legal right to modify or access any systems, code, or data provided.</li>
          <li>Maintaining current backups of code, data, and infrastructure before work begins.</li>
          <li>Reviewing and testing delivered work in their own environment prior to production use.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-3">
          I strongly recommend that clients use version control (such as Git) and maintain backups before
          granting access or applying changes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Third-Party Services & Dependencies -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-2">4. Third-Party Services & Dependencies</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
          Many projects involve third-party platforms or services, including but not limited to:
          cloud providers (such as AWS), APIs, plugins, libraries, hosting providers, email services,
          telephony platforms, and content management systems.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          I do not control these third-party services and cannot be responsible for their availability,
          performance, pricing, behavior, or changes over time. Any work that integrates with or depends
          on third-party services is subject to the terms, limitations, and reliability of those services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Breakage, outages, or changes resulting from third-party updates, policy changes, deprecations,
          or downtime are outside of my control and responsibility.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Existing Code and Environments -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-2">5. Existing Code and Environments</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
          When working in an existing codebase or infrastructure (including legacy systems, staging,
          or production environments), I cannot guarantee the overall stability, security, or quality
          of code or configuration that I did not create.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          My responsibility is limited to the specific changes or deliverables agreed for a given project
          or engagement. I am not responsible for pre-existing bugs, architectural issues, security
          vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or future changes made by the client or third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          For any work performed directly in live or production environments, the client acknowledges
          the inherent risks and agrees to have current backups and rollback plans in place.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Data, Security & Backups -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-2">6. Data, Security & Backups</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
          While I strive to follow good security and operational practices, the client is ultimately
          responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Controlling access to their systems, credentials, and data.</li>
          <li>Managing user permissions, keys, and secrets.</li>
          <li>Implementing and maintaining appropriate backup and recovery strategies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-3">
          I am not liable for data loss, corruption, or security incidents, particularly where backups
          are not in place, access is broadly shared, or best practices are not followed by the client
          or other vendors.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Limitation of Liability -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-2">7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
          To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any liability arising out of services
          provided is limited to the total amount paid for those specific services. In no event shall I
          be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary damages, including
          but not limited to loss of revenue, loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption,
          or reputational harm.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- No Legal, Compliance, or Regulatory Guarantees -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-2">
          8. No Legal, Compliance, or Regulatory Guarantees
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
          Even when working in regulated contexts (such as healthcare, financial services, or
          payment environments), I do not provide legal, regulatory, or compliance advice. Any
          references to frameworks (such as HIPAA, PCI, or similar) are for context only and do
          not constitute a guarantee of compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clients are responsible for obtaining their own legal, compliance, and security guidance
          as needed.
        </p>

      <!-- Changes to These Terms -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-400 mb-2">9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          These terms may be updated from time to time. The version posted on this website at the time
          of engagement will apply to that engagement. Continued use of my services after changes are posted
          constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
